# Find the Beer
Simple web application that finds beer using the ArcGIS JavaScript API. The solution is hosted on the repository's Github page `https://realmrtim.github.io/find-the-beer/`.

## Running the solution
1. Install the node dependencies with npm:

    `npm install`

2. Transpile and watch for any changes to the widget source files:

    `npm run build:widgets`

3. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome.

4. **Enjoy the beer**.

## Notes
* The hosted solution is based on the `gh-pages` branch of this repository
* I've tagged the individual tasks on the master branch for reference
* The solution has been developed and tested in Google Chrome only.
